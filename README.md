### Note: Glassdoor scraper on file only scrapes 1000 jobs on the Canadian Glassdoor website, which will only give you less than 100 rows of data to work with after data cleaning (unlike if you scrape from the US Glassdoor site).  For comparative learning and practice, will revisit and increase the number of jobs being scraped after completing this end-to-end project with less than 100 rows of data first.

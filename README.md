### A project solely for a quick end-to-end exposure of how a data science project may work from data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, building models, and implementing the code to production.  This is a data science salary predictor project repo; predictions are based on position name, company, industry, certain skills, and geographic location.  

### Note: Glassdoor scraper on file only scrapes 1000 jobs on the Canadian Glassdoor website, which will only give you less than 100 rows of data to work with after data cleaning (unlike if you scrape from the US Glassdoor site).  For comparative learning and practice, will revisit and increase the number of jobs being scraped after completing this end-to-end project with less than 100 rows of data first.

Data Scientist,-1,"Wanted: A Data visualisation expert who will help us transform customer data into actionable insight

PN is looking for an ambitious, persuasive data visualization guru who’s passionate about health, fitness and helping people live their best life.

Precision Nutrition is growing, and we need a results-driven business intelligence analyst to mine our customer data, develop analysis and deliver recommendations to product and digital marketing groups. As one of the largest nutrition coaching companies in the world, PN is bigger than it’s ever been — and it’s about to get bigger.

To help us scale, we need a data visualization specialist who knows how to synthesize data into plain English so we can help millions more people live healthier, happier lives.

Join our Adventure

We’re embarking on a new adventure, and we need a multi-talented data scientist to drive the analysis that strengthens our product offers

We’ve got an exciting journey ahead of us… Over the next 10 years, Precision Nutrition will be expanding its world-class education and coaching services into a wide range of new fields, including yoga, group exercise, sports coaching, athletics, manual therapy and more.

To help us reach our goals and keep us moving forward, we need a data scientist who knows how to distill complex data into actionable steps—and communicate it to the right people.

Who we’re looking for

A shrewd data hound with the ability to communicate clearly

You’re naturally curious. You have an inquisitive mind, and you’re always looking for hard numbers to uncover patterns and insights in the way people think and work. You want to know what makes people tick, and gaining a deep understanding of your customers drives you to develop innovative solutions to solve their problems.

You’re self-motivated. Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don’t need a lot of direction. You have strong self-structure and discipline and have worked remotely either currently or in the past so you know the benefits and the challenges. At the same time, you don’t silo yourself, and are always eager to learn more and share with the team.

You’re results-driven and have a strong bias for action. You get energized by developing recommendations that improve our product, and you excel at understanding and optimizing the journey our customers go through. You excel at knowing how to prioritize, adapt quickly when the scope changes—because it often will—and juggle lots of moving parts.

You’re a confident decision maker. Since you’ll be collaborating with people across the organization, you’ll be taking in a lot of competing input and synthesizing that into a specific course of action. You aren’t afraid to take on the authority and accountability needed to make a decision and drive the plan forward in the way you think will have the biggest effect. You don’t water down the plan to please everyone.

You’re an excellent communicator. You know how to say it, write it and present it in both layman’s terms and a bit more formally if needed. You know how to be heard and energize people around you, even when you’re “managing up” and presenting recommendations to the board.

You’re a motivating, team-oriented, people person. Let’s face it, in order to get other people to execute on your projects, you must be able to easily build relationships and credibility. You earn and give respect so that you can collaborate with the team and persuade the right people of your recommendations. Oh, and since you get to do all of this remotely, from the comfort of your home, and you won’t be going into an office every day to wrangle the team—so your people and leadership skills are truly first class.

What you’ll be doing

Seeking constant opportunities to make our product offerings better

You’re the navigator, deciphering the map and telling the captains the best course to their destination.

Your mission is simple: comb through customer data to find the best areas for improvement, and relay that to the business side of the company. That means:
Building and monitoring metrics. You’ll work through requirements for surveys and dashboards, and monitor KPIs over time to identify trends and build models that explain how our customers interact with our organization and use our product.
Collaborating with the data and analytics group. On the other end of things, you’ll also help set up and automate data collection and aggregation to support analytical needs.
Presenting to stakeholders. Once you identify areas for improvement, you’ll need to present your case to the marketing or product team, explaining what the data tells us and how to make that campaign or product feature better (or discussing possible areas we need to dig deeper).
A few important caveats

This is a dream job, if you’re the right person for it.

Must-Have #1: You must be experienced. We’re looking for someone with 3-5 years of experience in a data scientist position, ideally with a degree in math, stats, or computer science. You must have a demonstrated track record of going from data exploration to analysis and presentation of recommended actions that resulted in a business improvement.

Must-Have #2: You must know the tools of the trade. You have a solid understanding of data manipulation and visualization, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, and customer segmentation—and the tools that go along with those. You can develop visualization dashboards in reporting tools such as Tableau like a pro, and you have experience with data science tools like Heap, Panda, SciKit, and others, as well as manipulate and analyze data in SQL and Python.

Must-Have #3: You must be comfortable collaborating and communicating. Your job extends beyond analyzing the numbers, so you’ll need to be just as comfortable presenting recommendations to others as you are digging through data on your own. In particular, you excel at translating technical concepts into business-driven advice.

Wondering if this is the right path for you?

Every year, professionals at the top of their field choose to join Precision Nutrition.

Here are some reasons why.

Reason #1: We give you the freedom to “do you.”

Unlike most companies, we don’t have rigid rules about how and when to do things. You’ll always be free to work independently, whenever, wherever, and however you want -- without the bureaucracy and office politics.

Reason #2: You can work from anywhere.

We’re a 100% remote company, and have been working remote for 17 years. We’re ideally looking for candidates in Canada, but will consider the US as well. When you join our team, you’re no longer shackled to one desk in one office!

Reason #3: Meetings are optional. (No, really.)

You’re an adult. You’re capable of deciding how your time should be spent. If you don’t think you need to attend a meeting, you don’t. Simple as that.

Reason #4: You’ll always feel supported.

In a regular office, it’s easy to feel like a hamster in a wheel, powerless to change things. At Precision Nutrition, we work as a team to overcome issues & barriers that stand in each other’s way, and we treat each other with enthusiasm, compassion, and care.

Reason #5: You’ll never be bored.

People often come to Precision Nutrition after hitting a plateau in their old jobs. At PN, you’ll get the chance to chart new territories in your space, conquer new challenges, learn from the best, and reach thrilling new heights of personal and professional growth.

Reason #6: You’re free to be you.

At Precision Nutrition, we want everyone to live healthier, happier lives—no matter your race, age, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. That's why diversity is a key ingredient of our workforce, so we can best represent the people we serve. Everyone is welcome—as an inclusive workplace, we want our employees to bring their authentic whole selves to work. Be you.

Reason #7: You’ll have autonomy.

Not every data scientist job allows you time in the driver’s seat, but with this position, you’ll be taking charge of the analytical projects related to our product, and even make up your own projects that help make us better. You’ll never be bored by the range of tasks you get to work on.

Plus: no commute ... and no 9-to-5 grind.

Who we are:

http://www.rideco.com

RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses, vans, and cars. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as San Antonio Metro, Los Angeles Metro, San Diego County, Grab, and Calgary Transit.

Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van/sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.

RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.

Our talent optimization software combats the billion-dollar turnover problem, enabling hourly employers to retain employees longer and put their money where it counts. We help employers retain hourly employees longer through a software platform built on data and people science. Unlike others in the field, we provide the real solution to turnover: proactive and intelligent retention management.

We believe everyone wants to be successful and its up to businesses to create the environment to make this happen. As a company, we practice what we preach and are an equal opportunity employer, welcoming everyone to our team. This also cascades into the work we do and technology we build.

Key Responsibilities:

We're a startup, which means that the boundaries of your role are likely to blur. Broadly speaking, you will be involved with this type of work:
Identify the problems. With data and feedback from our clients, we deep dive into the problem.
Prepare the data. It is quite normal for data scientists to spend 80% of their time cleaning, moving, checking, organising data before even actually using it...we know this, and we plan for it!
Choose the algorithms. Reading and reading and thinking. Algorithms are a tool and using the right tool for the job makes the job easier. In light of findings when we explore the problem in great detail we will make this selection together as a team! We will ask you to share suggestions, listing pros and cons.
Train and test the algorithms. Finally, right? We often think AI starts here - but it doesn't...this is one of the last steps. We will compare performance and outputs, make tweaks and look again.
Scale up. Scaling up is the last step! This involves cleanly automating the data prep and processing, and figuring out the best way to deliver results. We will enlist client feedback and designers to support!
Your 'Must Have' Qualifications:

You approach the world with curiosity and desire to learn. You are proactive and resourceful. If you dont know an answer, you will find it! You're relentlessly solution-focused, dedicated to solving complex problems. You love to iterate and experiment. The pace, energy, and uncertainty of startup get you excited!

Probability & Statistics: Use statistics as a model evaluation metric: confusion matrices, receiver-operator curves, p-values, etc.
Data Modelling & Evaluation: Appropriate accuracy/error measure (e.g. log-loss for classification, sum-of-squared-errors for regression, etc.) and an evaluation strategy (training-testing split, sequential vs. randomized cross-validation, etc.)
Machine Learning Algorithms: Understanding of algorithm theory and knowing how the algorithm works, you can also discriminate models such as SVMs. Knowledge of Python packages like Pandas, scikit-learn
Your Benefits

In this role you will have access to real, proprietary data from deepNDs clients, which is critical to build meaningful solutions. You will work closely with a tight-knit founding team to rapidly design and build new generation analytical solutions that provide a disruptive solution to real-world hiring problems. You will have the full support of the CTO - a 2-time technical founder and experienced technical leader with extensive computational expertise and a PhD in Bioinformatics - and access to companys technical advisors. deepNDs CEO and a team of HR experts will also be readily available to provide domain knowledge.

More specifically, your benefits will include:
Paid internship ($15 to $20 per hour)
Flexible work hours (you're an adult, so you're in charge of your own work hours)
Remote work arrangement (because #COVID)
Peer support (you're joining a strong technical team!)

Chef de file mondial de l'intelligence artificielle, Element AI poursuit un objectif commun, celui d'utiliser nos vastes capacités de recherche pour développer des produits et logiciels d'IA offrant des solutions aux problèmes complexes auxquels font face les entreprises et la société en général.

Nous croyons que l'être humain doit toujours rester au cœur de tout ce que nous faisons. C'est pourquoi nous avons adopté une approche collaborative et humaine, afin que nos objectifs restent toujours éthiques et ancrés dans le réel.

L'équipe d'analyse chronologique est un équipe d'experts interdisciplinaire dont le mandat est de développer des outils basés sur l'apprentissage automatique et l'intelligence artificielle pour résoudre des problèmes industriels complexes dans les domaines des prévisions fondées sur l'analyse chronologique, de la détection d'anomalies temporelles et séquentielles, des systèmes de recommandation temporels, de la modélisation spatiotemporelle, des analyses de type « temps avant événement » et plusieurs autres.

Ce que vous ferez :

Confronté à des problèmes concrets et des jeux de données réels, vous devrez mettre à profit votre expertise et votre créativité pour appliquer les méthodes existantes (et en développer de nouvelles) afin de trouver des solutions pratiques et flexibles. Vous serez appelé à contribuer à l'évaluation de différentes possibilités et partager vos idées et vos commentaires concernant la conception des produits. Vous devrez donc évaluer et comprendre les besoins des clients (internes ou externes) pour les traduire en solutions pertinentes et applicables.

Vous devrez en outre effectuer la recherche nécessaire pour proposer des modèles et techniques appropriés et démontrer l'expertise pour mettre en place et former les modèles vous-même. Lorsque pertinent, vous n'hésiterez pas à appliquer les méthodes classiques d'apprentissage automatique, mais vous êtes également prêts à innover et repousser les frontières de l'apprentissage automatique, de l'apprentissage profond et de l'IA.

Finalement, vous devrez comprendre et accepter que la valeur de votre travail se reflète dans son impact sur l'utilisateur final de nos produits; trouver des façons de mesurer cet impact doit faire partie intégrante de votre mission.

Profil recherché :

Vous avez une expérience considérable en modélisation et en analyse chronologiques, soit en prévision en détection des anomalies. Vous avez une connaissance approfondie ou un intérêt marqué pour la théorie derrière l'apprentissage automatique et d'autres domaines de l'IA, acquise au fil de vos études, de votre expérience dans l'industrie et de projets personnels sensationnels. Vous êtes à l'aise à exprimer vos idées sous forme de code et n'avez pas peur de vous retrousser les manches et contribuer aux tâches de programmation et d'ingénierie.

Vous comprenez que de tester un modèle avec les données variées et excessives associées à un contexte commercial est différent que de le tester dans un contexte académique « propre » — vous savez que de modifier un modèle ou une technique dans un tel environnement peut représenter un défi de taille. Cela ne vous effraie pas, vous avez peut-être même de l'expérience avec ce genre de défis.

Vous apprenez de manière autonome et vous êtes toujours à l'affût des plus récentes découvertes et techniques dans votre domaine; vous êtes motivé à participer aux différentes occasions d'apprentissage que nous offrons.

Le ou la candidat(e) idéal(e) aura de l'expérience ou de bonnes connaissances touchant à un vaste éventail de sujets : modélisation chronologique, nettoyage de données, répartition, ingénierie de fonctionnalités, processus stochastiques, modèles chronologiques classiques, techniques d'apprentissage automatique pour les problèmes de régression, etc. Si vous avez déjà résolu un problème de prévision chronologique de A à Z – vous serez à votre place dans notre équipe!

Ce que nous vous offrons :
Faites équipe avec d'autres passionnés de l'IA;
Profitez d'un excellent équilibre travail-vie;
Laissez votre marque dans une industrie en plein essor;
Déployez votre talent pour affronter de nouveaux défis chaque jour;
Vous serez étonné de tout ce que vous apprendrez;
Culture d'entreprise ouverte et inclusive.
Element AI souscrit au principe de l'égalité d'accès à l'emploi et favorise la diversité au sein du personnel. Nous ne pratiquons aucune discrimination sur la base de la race, de la religion, de la couleur de peau, du pays d'origine, du sexe, de l'orientation sexuelle, de l'âge, de l'état matrimonial, du statut d'ancien combattant ou des incapacités.

Element AI is one of the world's largest artificial intelligence companies, with a shared goal of using our extensive research to develop AI products and software that will solve some of the most challenging issues facing businesses and society as a whole.

We are founded on the belief that humans should be at the heart of everything we do, and have adopted a people-first and collaborative mindset to ensure we collectively drive real and ethically-sound results.

The AI Core Time Series team is a cross-disciplinary team of experts that develops Machine Learning-based and AI-based tools for solving complex industrial problems in the fields of time series forecasting, temporal and sequential anomaly detection, temporal recommendation systems, spatio-temporal modelling, time-to-event, and the like.

What you'll do:

You will be confronted with real-world challenges and datasets, and you will need to use your expertise and creativity to apply existing methods and develop new ones to solve these problems in a practical and scalable way. You will be called upon to assess possibilities and provide ideas and input into product design choices. This will involve understanding your customer (internal or external) needs and translating them into solutions that address those needs.

You will be expected to both do the necessary research to propose appropriate models/techniques and to have the necessary expertise to implement and train the models yourself. Where useful, you will not hesitate to employ classical forecasting methods, but you are enthusiastic about the idea of pushing the boundaries of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI.

Finally, you will be expected to embrace the fact that the value of your work is ultimately reflected in the impact it has on the end-customers using our products and to find ways of measuring that impact as an integral part of your mission.

What we're looking for:

You have significant experience with time series modelling and analysis from either a forecasting or anomaly detection perspective. You also have an understanding or significant interest in the underlying theory of machine learning or related AI field. This expertise can come from extensive studies, previous industrial experience or awesome self-taught projects you have done on a personal basis. You are comfortable expressing ideas into code and do not mind getting your hands dirty in various coding and engineering tasks.

You understand that running a model on the varied and often noisy data that arise in a commercial context differs significantly from running it on a clean academic dataset and that modifying a model or technique to work in that setting can be a significant and sometimes frustrating challenge. You embrace this challenge and may even have previous experience tackling it.

You learn autonomously and will enthusiastically stay up to date with the literature and techniques of your field while participating in the various learning opportunities we offer.

The ideal candidate would have experience or familiarity with topics such as time series modelling and analysis, data cleaning, imputation, feature engineering, stochastic processes, various classical time series models, machine learning techniques for regression problems. If you have experience solving a time series forecasting problem end to end, then you'll fit right in!

What we offer for your valuable work:
Work closely with other AI enthusiasts;
Enjoy your work and life harmony;
Leave your mark in a thriving industry;
Apply your talent to tackling new challenges everyday;
Be surprised at how much you will learn;
Open and inclusive company culture.

Chef de file mondial de l'intelligence artificielle, Element AI poursuit un objectif commun, celui d'utiliser nos vastes capacités de recherche pour développer des produits et logiciels d'IA offrant des solutions aux problèmes complexes auxquels font face les entreprises et la société en général.

Nous croyons que l'être humain doit toujours rester au cœur de tout ce que nous faisons. C'est pourquoi nous avons adopté une approche collaborative et humaine, afin que nos objectifs restent toujours éthiques et ancrés dans le réel.

L'équipe de solutions – science et recherche accompagne les clients d'Element AI dans leur parcours vers l'IA. Nous sommes une équipe d'experts de l'intelligence artificielle dont le travail vise avant tout à répondre aux besoins concrets de nos clients. Nous souhaitons avoir un impact direct sur les interactions de nos utilisateurs avec leurs données, afin que cette relation leur permette de jouir d'un avantage puissant sur leurs concurrents. Nous sommes une équipe d'experts interdisciplinaire dont le mandat est de développer des outils basés sur l'apprentissage automatique et l'intelligence artificielle pour résoudre des problèmes industriels complexes dans les domaines des prévisions fondées sur l'analyse chronologique, de la détection d'anomalies temporelles et séquentielles, des systèmes de recommandation temporels, de la modélisation spatiotemporelle, des analyses de type « temps avant événement » et plusieurs autres.

Ce que vous ferez :

Confronté à des problèmes concrets et des jeux de données réels, vous devrez mettre à profit votre expertise et votre créativité pour appliquer les méthodes existantes (et en développer de nouvelles) afin de trouver des solutions pratiques et flexibles. Vous serez appelé à contribuer à l'évaluation de différentes possibilités et partager vos idées et vos commentaires concernant la conception des produits. Vous devrez donc évaluer et comprendre les besoins des clients (internes ou externes) pour les traduire en solutions pertinentes et applicables.

Vous devrez en outre effectuer la recherche nécessaire pour proposer des modèles et techniques appropriés et démontrer l'expertise pour mettre en place et former les modèles vous-même. Lorsque pertinent, vous n'hésiterez pas à appliquer les méthodes classiques d'apprentissage automatique, mais vous êtes également prêts à innover et repousser les frontières de l'apprentissage automatique, de l'apprentissage profond et de l'IA.

Finalement, vous devrez comprendre et accepter que la valeur de votre travail se reflète dans son impact sur l'utilisateur final de nos produits; trouver des façons de mesurer cet impact doit faire partie intégrante de votre mission. Vous devrez donc adopter une approche axée sur le client.

Profil recherché :

Vous avez une expérience considérable en modélisation et en analyse chronologiques, du point de vue de la prévision. Vous avez une connaissance approfondie ou un intérêt marqué pour la théorie derrière l'apprentissage automatique et d'autres domaines de l'IA, acquise au fil de vos études, de votre expérience dans l'industrie et de projets personnels sensationnels. Vous êtes à l'aise à exprimer vos idées sous forme de code et n'avez pas peur de vous retrousser les manches et contribuer aux tâches de programmation et d'ingénierie.

Vous comprenez que de tester un modèle avec les données variées et excessives associées à un contexte commercial est différent que de le tester dans un contexte académique « propre » — vous savez que de modifier un modèle ou une technique dans un tel environnement peut représenter un défi de taille. Cela ne vous effraie pas, vous avez peut-être même de l'expérience avec ce genre de défis.

Vous apprenez de manière autonome et vous êtes toujours à l'affût des plus récentes découvertes et techniques dans votre domaine; vous êtes motivé à participer aux différentes occasions d'apprentissage que nous offrons.

Le ou la candidat(e) idéal(e) aura de l'expérience ou de bonnes connaissances touchant à un vaste éventail de sujets : modélisation, représentation et analyse chronologique, nettoyage et ingénierie de données, répartition, ingénierie de fonctionnalités, processus stochastiques, modèles chronologiques classiques, techniques d'apprentissage automatique pour les problèmes de régression, etc. Si vous avez déjà résolu un problème de prévision chronologique de A à Z – vous serez à votre place dans notre équipe!

Ce que nous vous offrons :
Faites équipe avec d'autres passionnés de l'IA;
Profitez d'un excellent équilibre travail-vie;
Laissez votre marque dans une industrie en plein essor;
Déployez votre talent pour affronter de nouveaux défis chaque jour;

Element AI is one of the world's largest artificial intelligence companies, with a shared goal of using our extensive research to develop AI products and software that will solve some of the most challenging issues facing businesses and society as a whole.

We are founded on the belief that humans should be at the heart of everything we do, and have adopted a people-first and collaborative mindset to ensure we collectively drive real and ethically-sound results.

The Science and Research solution team supports Element AI's clients on their AI journey. We are a group of artificial intelligence experts who thrives on solving concrete client needs. We aim to have a direct impact on our users' interactions with data and that this relationship is the key to get an unfair advantage on their competitors. The team is a cross-disciplinary team of experts that develops Machine Learning-based and AI-based tools for solving complex industrial problems in various fields such as time series forecasting, temporal and sequential anomaly detection, temporal recommendation systems, spatio-temporal modelling, time-to-event, and the like.

What you'll do:

You will be confronted with real-world challenges and datasets, and you will need to use your expertise and creativity to apply existing methods and develop new ones to solve these problems in a practical and scalable way. You will be called upon to assess possibilities and provide ideas and input into product design choices. This will involve understanding your customer (internal or external) needs and translating them into solutions that address those needs.

You will be expected to both do the necessary research to propose appropriate models/techniques and to have the necessary expertise to implement and train the models yourself. Where useful, you will not hesitate to employ classical forecasting methods, but you are enthusiastic about the idea of pushing the boundaries of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI.

Finally, you will be expected to embrace the fact that the value of your work is ultimately reflected in the impact it has on the end-customers using our products and to find ways of measuring that impact as an integral part of your mission. As such you will have a customer-first mindset.

What we're looking for:

You have significant experience with time series modelling and analysis from a forecasting perspective. You also have an understanding or significant interest in the underlying theory of machine learning or related AI field. This expertise can come from extensive studies, previous industrial experience or awesome self-taught projects you have done on a personal basis. You are comfortable expressing ideas into code and do not mind getting your hands dirty in various coding and engineering tasks.

You understand that running a model on the varied and often noisy data that arise in a commercial context differs significantly from running it on a clean academic dataset and that modifying a model or technique to work in that setting can be a significant and sometimes frustrating challenge. You embrace this challenge and may even have previous experience tackling it.

You learn autonomously and will enthusiastically stay up to date with the literature and techniques of your field while participating in the various learning opportunities we offer.

The ideal candidate would have experience or familiarity with topics such as time series data representation, modelling and analysis, data cleaning & engineering, imputation, feature engineering, stochastic processes, various classical time series models and machine learning techniques for regression problems. If you have experience solving a time series forecasting problem end to end, then you'll fit right in!

What we offer for your valuable work:
Work closely with other AI enthusiasts;
Enjoy your work and life harmony;
Leave your mark in a thriving industry;
Apply your talent to tackling new challenges everyday;
Be surprised at how much you will learn;
Open and inclusive company culture.

Data collected in these studies is then used to address key research questions such as:
Burden of disease and identification of unmet needs
Treatment patterns, drug utilization, adherence
Resource utilization
The identification and impact of risk factors on disease outcomes
Comparative effectiveness
Safety outcomes
We use epidemiologic methods to build knowledge of the relationships between patient, drug, clinical and disease factors that significantly aids our clients and the patients they serve in understanding health conditions and navigating potential drug-event causal relationships as well as in building stronger evidence-based value messages.

Our focus is on helping our clients identify evidence gaps and rapidly build epidemiologic and economic evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness, safety and value of their products. For this role, the focus is on de novo (field) data collection studies such as single and multi-country retrospective chart reviews, surveys, prospective studies, registries and post-market safety studies which are undertaken when existing health databases cannot be used. Increasingly, hybrid studies that invoke the use of both secondary data sources with bespoke data collection methods are deployed to address our clients’ needs.

Data collected in these studies is then used to address key research questions such as:
Burden of disease and identification of unmet needs
Treatment patterns, drug utilization, adherence
Resource utilization
The identification and impact of risk factors on disease outcomes
Comparative effectiveness
Safety outcomes
We use epidemiologic methods to build knowledge of the relationships between patient, drug, clinical and disease factors that significantly aids our clients and the patients they serve in understanding health conditions and navigating potential drug-event causal relationships as well as in building stronger evidence-based value messages.

Our focus is on helping our clients identify evidence gaps and rapidly build epidemiologic and economic evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness, safety and value of their products. For this role, the focus is on de novo (field) data collection studies such as single and multi-country retrospective chart reviews, surveys, prospective studies, registries and post-market safety studies which are undertaken when existing health databases cannot be used. Increasingly, hybrid studies that invoke the use of both secondary data sources with bespoke data collection methods are deployed to address our clients’ needs.

Data collected in these studies is then used to address key research questions such as:
Burden of disease and identification of unmet needs
Treatment patterns, drug utilization, adherence
Resource utilization
The identification and impact of risk factors on disease outcomes
Comparative effectiveness
Safety outcomes
We use epidemiologic methods to build knowledge of the relationships between patient, drug, clinical and disease factors that significantly aids our clients and the patients they serve in understanding health conditions and navigating potential drug-event causal relationships as well as in building stronger evidence-based value messages.

The Team
Evidera has been providing epidemiology, data analytics, and outcomes research services to clients in the biopharmaceutical industry for over 19 years. The Peri- and Post Approval Studies team supports pharmaceutical/ biotechnology/ medical device companies in the design and conduct of real-world observational studies throughout the product lifecycle, from early pre-launch planning to launch and post-marketing management. Our focus is on helping our clients identify evidence gaps and rapidly build epidemiologic and economic evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness, safety and value of their products. For this role, the focus is on de novo (field) data collection studies such as single and multi-country retrospective chart reviews, surveys, prospective studies, registries and post-market safety studies which are undertaken when existing health databases cannot be used. Increasingly, hybrid studies that invoke the use of both secondary data sources with bespoke data collection methods are deployed to address our clients’ needs.

Data collected in these studies is then used to address key research questions such as:
Burden of disease and identification of unmet needs
Treatment patterns, drug utilization, adherence
Resource utilization
The identification and impact of risk factors on disease outcomes
Comparative effectiveness
Safety outcomes
We use epidemiologic methods to build knowledge of the relationships between patient, drug, clinical and disease factors that significantly aids our clients and the patients they serve in understanding health conditions and navigating potential drug-event causal relationships as well as in building stronger evidence-based value messages.

The Team
Evidera has been providing epidemiology, data analytics, and outcomes research services to clients in the biopharmaceutical industry for over 19 years. The Peri- and Post Approval Studies team supports pharmaceutical/ biotechnology/ medical device companies in the design and conduct of real-world observational studies throughout the product lifecycle, from early pre-launch planning to launch and post-marketing management. Our focus is on helping our clients identify evidence gaps and rapidly build epidemiologic and economic evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness, safety and value of their products. For this role, the focus is on de novo (field) data collection studies such as single and multi-country retrospective chart reviews, surveys, prospective studies, registries and post-market safety studies which are undertaken when existing health databases cannot be used. Increasingly, hybrid studies that invoke the use of both secondary data sources with bespoke data collection methods are deployed to address our clients’ needs.

Data collected in these studies is then used to address key research questions such as:
Burden of disease and identification of unmet needs
Treatment patterns, drug utilization, adherence
Resource utilization
The identification and impact of risk factors on disease outcomes
Comparative effectiveness
Safety outcomes
We use epidemiologic methods to build knowledge of the relationships between patient, drug, clinical and disease factors that significantly aids our clients and the patients they serve in understanding health conditions and navigating potential drug-event causal relationships as well as in building stronger evidence-based value messages.
